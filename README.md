# GrabABite

Everyone living in a college hostel dreads MESS FOOD. While studying for the exams and burning the midnight oil students usually find themselves hungry way past midnight and are left with very limited options to eat but don’t have any proper information about them.
This project aims to put an end to all these struggles by compiling all these information in one place (through an app) accessible to everyone. The project will maintain a database of all nearby restaurants and eateries. What’s more it will also show where someone can GrabABite anytime on a 24 hour clock.
